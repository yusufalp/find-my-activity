      How to use this website?
    </h2>
    <p>
      There are two sections in this website where you can interact about the activities: Find and Add Activity.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Find Activity section, search activities by the category. Choose outdoors if you want your child to work on something outdoor. Do you want something more like academics related, we got that. How about sports? We are constantly increasing the amount of the categories as we see more requests.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Add Activity section, you can add your own activity. Have you been doing an activity with your child, share it with our community. Simply add the details of the activity requested and it will be posted for our users to search for.
    </p>
    <p>
      Enjoy!
